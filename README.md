# Text-Generator-using-LSTM

---> The Main Goal was to explore and  learn, How LSTM Translates the text data based on the text input and how it process and Manipulates and predict the next word based on the previous inputs

---> And also explored how LSTM retain the text data of very long term context and how the LSTM Architecture works and process the data from the input and produces the output.

---> LSTM consist of three gates where each sentence is fedded as input in the form of vector where this gates process and manipulates the data and produces the output

---> Three types of gates are

          1) Forget gate

          2) Input gate

          3) Output gate

# Realtime Applications of LSTM

1) Time Series

2) Forecasting

3) Transfer learning
